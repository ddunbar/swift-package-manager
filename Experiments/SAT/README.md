* [x] Basic DPLL solver for boolean SAT.
* [ ] Add constraint dependency graph (+ viz?).
* [ ] Add support for CDCL.
* [ ] Switch to package version SAT model.
* [ ] Add support for dynamic formula exploration.
* [ ] Add rich diagnostics on failures.
* [ ] (Optional) Investigate forgetting support.
* [ ] (Optional) Investigate conflict clause minimization.
* [ ] (Optional) Investigate restart support.
* [ ] (Optional) Investigate parallel solving.
* [ ] (Optional) Investigate incremental solving.
